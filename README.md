# Computer Networks Lab

Welcome to the Computer Networks Lab repository! This repository contains practical exercises and hands-on experiments to complement the Computer Networks course, helping you gain practical knowledge in network protocols, programming, and performance analysis.

## Contents

- **Lab Experiments:** A collection of lab experiments covering essential topics in computer networks.
- **Assignments:** Practical tasks with step-by-step instructions.
- **Reference Materials:** Supplementary materials to help you complete the experiments.

## Syllabus

### 1. Study of Basic Network Commands
- **Objective:** Familiarize with basic networking commands (e.g., `ping`, `tracert`, `netstat`, `ipconfig`, `nslookup`).
- **Demo:** Introduction to networking hardware and functionalities (e.g., routers, switches, cables).
  
### 2. Error Detection and Correction Mechanisms
- **Objective:** Implement error detection methods like CRC and Hamming Code to detect and correct transmission errors.
  
### 3. Flow Control Mechanisms
- **Objective:** Develop flow control mechanisms (e.g., Sliding Window Protocol, Go-Back-N) to manage data transmission rates between sender and receiver.

### 4. IP Addressing (Classless Addressing)
- **Objective:** Understand and implement classless IP addressing schemes and subnetting.

### 5. Observing Packets Across the Network and Routing Protocol Performance Analysis
- **Objective:** Use tools like Wireshark to capture and analyze network packets.
- **Performance Analysis:** Compare routing protocol performance (e.g., OSPF, RIP) using simulators like Packet Tracer or GNS3.

### 6. Socket Programming (TCP and UDP)
- **Objective:** Develop challenging experiments involving socket programming for both TCP and UDP protocols.
- **Experiments:** Implement client-server models, handle multiple clients, and explore different socket options.

### 7. Simulation of Unicast Routing Protocols
- **Objective:** Simulate unicast routing protocols (e.g., RIP, OSPF) using network simulators and analyze their performance.

### 8. Simulation of Transport Layer Protocols
- **Objective:** Simulate transport layer protocols (TCP, UDP) and analyze congestion control techniques like TCP Congestion Control (e.g., Slow Start, Congestion Avoidance).

### 9. DNS Client-Server Implementation
- **Objective:** Develop a DNS client-server application to resolve given hostnames or IP addresses.
